# Auto Bone Parenting Blender Add-on

This is a Blender add-on that automatically parents selected objects to the closest bone in a selected armature.

To use it, in Object mode, simply select all objects you would like parenting as well as the armature and use the Object > Parent > Auto Bone Parenting menu option. The origin of the mesh has to be very close to the center of the bone for parenting to happen, so objects far from any bones will not get touched even if they have been selected.

## Blender Versions

While this add-on may work on Blender 2.80, it has only been tested on versions 3.0 and newer.
